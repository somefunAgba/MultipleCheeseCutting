##### Multiple Cheese Cutting Space Mapping Optimization
- [x] Aggressive Space Mapping
- [x] Implicit Space Mapping
- [x] Response Residual Space Mapping
- [x] Implict-Response Residual Space Mapping, Type-1
- [x] Implict-Response Residual Space Mapping, Type-2
- [x] Aggressive-Response Residual Space Mapping

##### The standard Implict-Response Residual Space Mapping, is the Implict-Response Residual Space Mapping, Type-1.
##### I have introduced a new algorithm flow for the Implicit-Response Residual Space Mapping Optimization, called Implict-Response Residual Space Mapping, Type-2

*This package contains my independent implementation of the Cheese-Cutting Illustration of Space Mapping Optimization using MATLAB.*
